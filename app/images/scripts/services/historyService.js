        "content":"McKinley used his innovation to found Mahaska Bottling Works, producing Strawberry and Root Beer soft drink flavors under the Chief Mahaska Flavors[b1]  brand. In 1912, McKinley took on a partner in U.G. Deck. In 1916, the passing of U.G. Deck afforded Harry Morgan the opportunity to purchase Mahaska Bottling Works. Harry Morgan was the first in the current line of Mahaska proprietors and was responsible for transforming Mahaska Bottling Works into the fully integrated manufacturing operation that was Mahaska Bottling Company—the first step in our transformation into the modern day Mahaska."
